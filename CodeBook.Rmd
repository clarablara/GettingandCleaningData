# Data, Calculations and Variables

### Description of Raw (Samsung) Data

The raw data to be analyzed by this program was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description of the Samsung data (including download links) is available here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

...

### Description of Transformations and Calculations Performed

The raw Samsung data was put through a series of transformations and calculations (through the `run_analysis.R` script) to result in a clean data set, `tidy_data.txt`. The steps of the analysis included:

1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set;
2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
3. Naming the activities in the data set with descriptive activity names;
4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names;
5. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

For a more complete description of how `run_analysis.R` works, please see the README file included in this repo.

### Description of Variables

*(NOTE: A complete description of the variables from the raw data set (and information on how specific measurements were obtained) can be found in the `features_info.txt` file included in the Samsung data set.)*
